#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
-----The client was the company DriverPas, wanting to create an app for those learning to drive. Allowing for them to sign up for driving instructional training, study material and take practice exams via the app. They wanted an application to allow for all functionality listed. 



##### What did you do particularly well?
----- I feel like I did a good job accounting for all required functionality. I made sure to implement all that they were wanting and then adding in some additional features to allow for ease of use for the customers. 



#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-----I would probably say the different diagrams. I don't feel like I am the strongest when creating graphical representations like these, and they could definitely use a once over. If I was to re-do them, I would probably ask for help, look for more help videos for creating them, etc. I just don't feel like I am that strong at making clean diagrams and I feel like they are jumbled and somewhat confusing.



#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-----To interpret the user's needs I just thought about my experiences while using different applications. I thought about what worked and didn't work. I thought about how things were made easy by way of design and tried to implement as much for the user as possible. It is important to consider such things because if the user has a very difficult time using the product, then they will probably stop using it. They will more than likely complain to the DriverPass company and you will gain a negative track record with that company. 



#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
-----I approach it by considering all necessary features that must be included. Then I try to logically picture what would be the most efficient way to implement those features. To me, simplicity and ease of use takes precedent. There is no need to make something more complicated than it needs to be. I'm not sure about any additional techniques or strategies that I would use. I feel that my current approach is efficient and useful.
